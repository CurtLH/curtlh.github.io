This outdoor bar is made of redwood and concrete. The base was constructed from redwood construction lumber and redwood fence pickets. The concrete was poured into a mold, and the small voids in the top were filled with white grout. The concrete was sealed with Cheng food-safe concrete countertop sealer.
