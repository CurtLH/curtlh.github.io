This cabinet was built from 3/4 inch Russian Birch plywood. The trim on the front of the cabinet is Burmese Teak from Mayan Hardwood. The paint is Jean Jacket Blue in a matte finish from Behr.

I also built 4 individual shelves to fit inside the cubes. These shelves can be reconfigured to have one per cube or multiple shelves can be stacked on top of one another more more options.
