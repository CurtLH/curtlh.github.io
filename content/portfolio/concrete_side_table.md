This side table is built from left over materials from another project. The base is consturcted from a redwood 2x4, and the top is from 20lbs of Quikrete concrete mix.The concrete is sealed with Cheng food-safe concrete countertop sealer. The table was originally build to be used outside, but has since found its home indoors.
